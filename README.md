## 🧠 Description

This project implements and analyzes an entropy-based method to estimate the Lyapunov coefficient from binary strings generated by the evolution of dynamical systems.

Binary strings are obtained by encoding trajectories of maps such as the **Arnold’s Cat Map** and the **Pomeau–Manneville Map** into discrete sequences, based on spatial partitioning.

The method evaluates the growth of Shannon entropy \( H(d) \) of substrings of length \( d \), and applies linear regression to derive an empirical Lyapunov coefficient.

- Distinguish between chaotic and regular dynamics based on entropy growth.
- Use entropy scaling to estimate Lyapunov exponents from symbolic data.
- Validate the method on hyperbolic and intermittent maps.
